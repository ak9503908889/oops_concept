# what is Abstraction: only showing the essential features of application is called abstration.
#Abstract classes and Abstarct methods  @@ python doesnt support abstrction.

# but using (abc--abstract base classes) we can achieve abstraction.

# ABSTRACT class: the class contains at least one abstact method is called abstract class,
# we cant create object of abstract class,
# u can use  " from abc import ABC,abstractmethod"  to create abstract class and
# just use @abstractmethod decorator before method creation in class.

## ABSTRACT METHOD : A method which is only declaration there is no any implemainatation
#  @abstractmethod    like that define decorator above method and pass that method
